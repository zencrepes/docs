### Do I need to deploy the entire ZenCrepes stack ?

No, if you want to trade usability for flexibility, you could simply use ZenCrepes indexer and dive in the data using Kibana.

### Where can I report issues, post suggestions ?

Simply post an issue here: https://github.com/zencrepes/zencrepes/issues

### How do I contribute ? Where can I report issues, post suggestions ?

Simply start by submitting an issue here: https://github.com/zencrepes/zencrepes/issues

### Do I need to deploy the entire ZenCrepes stack ?

No, if you want to trade usability for flexibility, you could simply use ZenCrepes indexer and dive in the data using Kibana.

### Do I need to backup the data

Not really, in the even your Elasticsearch cluster looses its data, it can be re-fetched using zindexer. ZenCrepes doesn't do any magic, it just displays data collected from its remote data sources via APIs.

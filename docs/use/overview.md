As mentioned in other sections of this document, ZenCrepes has been built to be Data-Centric. Each of the different tabs will present data as it is, with as little pre-made interpretation or assumptions as possible.

ZenCrepes presents facts, and it's up to the viewer to determine which course of actions to take with those factual elements (although of course, implementation might introduce bias).

If you're curious to understand the thought process that went into creating ZenCrepes, you can take a look at the following articles I've written while creating ZenCrepes:

## Datasets

In ZenCrepes, each dataset is treated independently and although common elements will be present (such as list of elements), each dataset will be presented in a way relevant to the data itself always keeping a focus on [ZenCrepes three primary objectives](http://docs.zencrepes.io/#what-is-zencrepes).

## User Interface

## Query-centric

ZenCrepes is query-centric, clicking on data elements or interacting with the backend is always done by means of a query.

Operating on the query is usually done through:

- Facets to progressively filter-down content
- Clicking on a chart element

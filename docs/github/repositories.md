For the organizations having a large number of repositories (some being less active than others) this view provides insight about repo's activity through color coding commits to master:

- Green: The repos has 20 commits or more in the past 3 months or if it has less than 20, all of its commits in the past 3 months (for new repos).
- Yellow: The repo only has 20 commits in 3 to 6 months
- Red: The repo has less than 20 commits overall (and over more than 3 months), or it took more than 7 months to get to 20 commits.
